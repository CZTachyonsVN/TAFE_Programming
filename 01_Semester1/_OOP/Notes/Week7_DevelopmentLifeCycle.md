# Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
There are different methodologies and systems for software development, but there are generally follow these phases:
- Requirement analysis
	- Gathering of project information
	- Analysis of needs, limitations, scope, etc.
- Planning and Design
	- Coming up with a preliminary outline of the project
	- Technical design
		- Charts, ERD, Class diagrams, etc...
	- UI prototypes
	- Other documents as a blueprint or guide for building the software
- Implementation
- Testing
	- Throughout the implementation phase and at the end
	- Quality assurance
	- Communicate with the development team
	- Methods:
		- Unit test
			- Individual modules / functionality
		- Integration test
			- Testing data transfer between different modules of the solution
		- System test
			- Series of test to verify integration of the software with other IT systems
		- User acceptance test
			- User feedback
- Deployment
	- Creating an installer
	- Deploying to hardware (servers, computers, mobile devices)
	- Training
	- Documentation
- Maintenance
	- Stabilisation period
	- Monitoring
	- Further QA
	- Adjustments
## Methodologies
### Waterfall
- Aka traditional method
- Strictly following phases one after the other
- Required understanding all project requirements that do not change
- Clearly defined stages
- Hard to adjust to changes
- Detailed planning
### Agile
**[[Week7_DevelopmentLifeCycle#Agile Manifesto|Manifesto]]**
- Breaking down the project in small sections
- Development phases are iterated for each section
	- Sprints
- Implementation of this methodology can be adjusted based on what the team needs
- Great flexibility
- Deployment and user verification can happen in stages before final deployment
- Scope and budget may change
- Requires good communication
Variations:<br>
**Feature Driven**
- Plan the project ahead with flexibility in development
- Project divided into its features with priorities
- Each iteration is focused on one feature
**Scrum**
- Planning happens for each iteration aka sprint
- Encourages daily communication between members of the team
- Most common method
**Rapid Application Development (RAD)**
- Creating working prototypes
- Rapid development of prototypes with each iteration
- Features are improved in each prototypes with each iteration
- Final product combines the prototypes
- Only suitable for a small team and small project
#### Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing  
software by doing it and helping others do it.  
Through this work we have come to value: <br>
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
Working software over comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
Responding to change over following a plan.<br>
That is, while there is value in the items on  
the right, we value the items on the left more.
### Spiral
- Thorough planning like Waterfall
- Iteration and flexibility of Agile
- Focusing on managing risks at the start of each cycle
	- Requires expertise
- Cycles are planned ahead
- Project is developed as a whole, not in parts
- Complexity should increase with each cycle
- For big projects that need flexibility
- Requires extensive planning and documentation
- Deployment happens at the end
- Ensuring quality and risk management
