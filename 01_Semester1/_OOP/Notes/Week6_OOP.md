#csharp #OOP 
# Inheritance
- Inheriting variables and methods/functions from a parent class
- C# only allow inheritance form one parent
# Polymorphism
- The ability to rewrite an inherited behaviour
	- Overriding
- The ability to create multiple implementation of the same method
	- Each implementations has to have a unique signature
		- Signature = set of method arguments
	- Overloading
# Encapsulation
- Hide variables and methods
- Avoid accidental or intentional misuse of variables and functions
# Constructor
- Method that runs at the beginning of a class instantiation
	- Initialising default variables
- Constructors can have multiple overrides
# Interface
- An abstract class with no implementation and empty properties
- Implementation happens in the class that an interface is attached to
- A class can inherit from a parent class and an multiple interface at the same time
# Abstract vs Virtual
- Abstract has no body and implementation and has to be implemented in child classes
- Virtual is implemented but can be overridden
