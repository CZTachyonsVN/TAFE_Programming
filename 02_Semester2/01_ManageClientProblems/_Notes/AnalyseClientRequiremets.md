# Information Gathering
- It is useful to **plan the discussion** before a meeting so you can get all the necessary information. Generally **open questions** will allow the client to best describe their requirements.
	- You should understand your organisation's **standards and policies**, as well as plan to get the required information from the client in a **short time**. It is a good idea to have a **standard set** of questions to ask your client.
- Questionnaires are used when you have to gather input from many people.
- Observation is a good technique to use to **understand how everything works as a whole**, and what changes are required for an upgrade or new system.
- Confirming the client’s requirements involves developing documentation to ensure you and the client have **the same understanding** of the requirements.
- As we explore and understand the client’s needs, we may **discover** additional requirements, which have been overlooked. For example, it might become apparent that additional data backup systems will be needed for the infrastructure. Further information about backup systems, such as DLT tape units or cloud-based solutions would need to be investigated.
> [!warning]
> It is important that any altered or additional requirements that might be discovered are documented. You should be overly **cautious** of verbal agreements. Before proceeding with any work, **confirm** the verbal agreement with a written agreement. Written documentation leaves much **less chance of error**, as may be the case with recalling facts differently from memory.

# Identify Client Requirements
> [!tip]
>If your service **responds to clients' needs** and makes your client feel valued, you and your organisation will build and maintain a strong reputation.<br>

- Understand client's **business goals and organisational guidelines**
- Identify **budget** for any future expansion
- Define client's requirements **clearly** using various techniques (interviewing, questionnaires, observation, etc...)
- Identify **stakeholders** and **sources of information**.
- Gain **understanding** of the existing system.
- **Document** all the above.
- Maintain good communication with the client

# Requirements Analysis
Reflect on requirements that the client has set and do relevant research on those subjects. Ask yourself important question regarding how do the requirements impact the client and how feasible they are to solve. What information should the client be provided with so they can make more informed decisions.<br>
For the analysis to be effective, take the following steps:
- Have questions for the client in a **written** form.
- Get a **standard** set of questions from your supervisor if it is available.
- **Record** client's answers accurately in **plain English** and as least jargon as possible.
	- **Explain** any jargon to the client.
- **Specify** what information you require from the client.
# Areas of Concern
### Standard Operating Environment (SOE)
Desktop operating system and applications should be the same across the networked computers. Having SOE is a big advantage for IT support since the software is standardised across the organisation, and end-users can switch to another computer with ease.
### Computer Hardware
It is a good business practice to replace computers that are not in warranty.
### Network
Network devices also need to be standardised. Using a mix of different vendors or models in the same product category may cause suboptimal performance. The maintenance will also be much simpler.
### Printers
Older printers will likely have higher running cost than newer models. Vendors may also stop supporting older devices which is a reliability and security issue.
# Auditing IT infrastructure
Before any solutions can be presented, you need a good understanding of the IT infrastructure. And audit will help you gain understanding of the entire system. Analyse it and find the root cause of client's issues. There are various software tools that help document the auditing process.
