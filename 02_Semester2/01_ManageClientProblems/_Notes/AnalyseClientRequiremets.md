# Information Gathering
- It is useful to **plan the discussion** before a meeting so you can get all the necessary information. Generally **open questions** will allow the client to best describe their requirements.
- Questionnaires are used when you have to gather input from many people.
- Observation is a good technique to use to **understand how everything works as a whole**, and what changes are required for an upgrade or new system.
- Confirming the client’s requirements involves developing documentation to ensure you and the client have **the same understanding** of the requirements.
- As we explore and understand the client’s needs, we may **discover** additional requirements, which have been overlooked. For example, it might become apparent that additional data backup systems will be needed for the infrastructure. Further information about backup systems, such as DLT tape units or cloud-based solutions would need to be investigated.
> [!warning]
> It is important that any altered or additional requirements that might be discovered are documented. You should be overly **cautious** of verbal agreements. Before proceeding with any work, **confirm** the verbal agreement with a written agreement. Written documentation leaves much **less chance of error**, as may be the case with recalling facts differently from memory.

# Identify Client Requirements
> [!tip]
If your service **responds to clients' needs** and makes your client feel valued, you and your organisation will build and maintain a strong reputation.
