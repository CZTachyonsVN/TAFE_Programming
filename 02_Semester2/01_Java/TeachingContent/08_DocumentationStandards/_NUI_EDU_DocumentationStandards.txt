Code and Documentation Standards:

Documentation is designed to explain what is being accomplished in the program in English, not code, so that anyone can pick up the program and be able to understand what is being done.

The main function must have a documentation box containing the following information:

/****************************************************************
   PROGRAM:   program name
   AUTHOR:    your name
   LOGON ID:  Z??????  (your Z number here)
   DUE DATE:  due date of program

   FUNCTION:  a short paragraph stating the purpose of the
              program.

   INPUT:     location of input, i.e.  standard input, a file on
              disk

   OUTPUT:    location and type of output, i.e.  a report
              containing a detail record for each city processed
              containing city id, Celsius temperature, Fahrenheit
              temperature and wind chill temperature.

   NOTES:     any relevant information that would be of
              additional help to someone looking at the program.
****************************************************************/

Each additional function must be documented. Each function must have a documentation box containing:

/****************************************************************

   FUNCTION:   function prototype statement

   ARGUMENTS:  a list of argument names and a short description

   RETURNS:    what the function returns

   NOTES:      a short paragraph stating what the function does
****************************************************************/

Each variable that is defined must be documented by stating the purpose of the variable.

int cnt,                    /* line counter             */
    sub,                    /* subscript                */
    tot_scr;                /* accumulator for scores   */

Place variable definitions in columnar form to allow for orderly definitions and descriptions.

Logical groupings of code must be explained with line documentation. For example, an if statement should be preceded by a sentence describing what is being done with the selection construct.

/* if the array element is smaller than the current key save the
   current subscript */

if (array\_element[sub] < current\_key)
   min\_sub = sub;

Header files should be documented with a documentation box containing the following information:

/****************************************************************
   FILE:      file name
   AUTHOR:    your name
   LOGON ID:  Z??????  (your Z number here)
   DUE DATE:  due date of program

   PURPOSE:   a short description of the resources found in the 
              header file.
****************************************************************/

Makefiles should also have a bit of documentation:

#
#  PROGRAM:   program name
#  AUTHOR:    your name
#  LOGON ID:  Z??????   (your Z number here)
#  DUE DATE:  due date of program
#
