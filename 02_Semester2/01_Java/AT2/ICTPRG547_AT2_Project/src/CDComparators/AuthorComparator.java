	 * Compares its two arguments for order.  Returns a negative integer,

	 * to, or greater than the second.<p>
	 * <p>
	 * The implementor must ensure that {@link Integer#signum
	 * signum}{@code (compare(x, y)) == -signum(compare(y, x))} for
	 * all {@code x} and {@code y}.  (This implies that {@code
	 * compare(x, y)} must throw an exception if and only if {@code
	 * compare(y, x)} throws an exception.)<p>
	 * <p>
	 * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
	 * {@code ((compare(x, y)>0) && (compare(y, z)>0))} implies
	 * {@code compare(x, z)>0}.<p>
	 * <p>
	 * Finally, the implementor must ensure that {@code compare(x,
	 * y)==0} implies that {@code signum(compare(x,
	 * z))==signum(compare(y, z))} for all {@code z}.
	 *
	 * @param cd1 the first object to be compared.
	 * @param cd2 the second object to be compared.
	 * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the
	 * first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the
	 * second.
	 * @throws NullPointerException if an argument is null and this
	 *                              comparator does not permit null arguments
	 * @throws ClassCastException   if the arguments' types prevent them from
	 *                              being compared by this comparator.
	 * @apiNote It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
	 * {@code (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))}.  Generally speaking,
	 * any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate
	 * this fact.  The recommended language is "Note: this comparator
	 * imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals."
