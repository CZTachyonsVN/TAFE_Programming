# Comparison between Relational and Non-Relational Databases
![Source](../../TeachingContent/RelationalVsNonRelationalDatabase.pdf)
## Overview
Relational databases have more rigid structure with defined relationships and data types. No-SQL databases are more flexible and structures are not enforced. <br>
No-SQL databases will have more issues with consistency and database integrity if it's not programmatically not ensured. <br>
SQL languages are pretty much the same across the board. No-SQL languages can be completely different from each other. <br>
SQL can do a lot of processing and complex queries, NoSQL acts more like a data structure for large amount of data and the rest is done programmatically.
